This is my "ideal" version, consistent naming, clean and concise code in main.
instead of a bunch of if statements, it uses an array of functions to call when a certain command is issued
It is actually slower that way (not at all an issue in that case) but can easily be expanded to have more commands
Anyway, kinda pointless and just to show off
